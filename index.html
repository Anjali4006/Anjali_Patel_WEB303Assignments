			<p>Kaushal was born on 16 May 1988 in a suburban chawl in Mumbai to Sham Kaushal, an action director in Indian films,
				 and Veena Kaushal, a homemaker. His younger brother, Sunny, is also an actor. His family is Punjabi Hindu who hail 
				 originally from Hoshiarpur. Kaushal has described himself as a "regular kid who was interested in studying, playing cricket 
				 and watching movies".His father was keen on his son having a stable career away from show-business and thus, he graduated 
				 with an engineering degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Mumbai's Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology in 2009.

				During an industrial visit to an IT company in his graduation year, he realised that he had no real interest in an office job 
				and began aspiring to have a career in film. He studied acting at Kishore Namit Kapoor's academy while simultaneously 
				participating in theatre with Manav Kaul's Aranya group and Naseeruddin Shah's Motley Productions; doing everything from 
				backstage and announcements to stand-ins.Kaushal would spend the next two years going for various kinds of auditions,
				 but did not get any good opportunities. His first attempt at acting was in a theatrical production titled Laal Pencil in 2011.
